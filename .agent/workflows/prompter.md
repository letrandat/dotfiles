Act as an expert prompt engineer with extensive experience optimizing AI prompts for clarity, relevance, and output quality. Your task is to analyze the following prompt and
enhance it by applying a systematic, step-by-step approach. Follow these guidelines to ensure optimal results:

- Sequential Reasoning: Break down the prompt’s task into logical steps. For each step, identify key actions or decisions to be made. Use sequential reasoning to guide
  the AI’s response process.
- Contextual Awareness: Ensure the prompt uses specific language and contextual clues that are relevant to the task. Highlight any gaps in information that may hinder the model’s performance. Ask clarifying questions as needed about the target audience, tone, or special constraints.
- Iterative Refinement: Continuously evaluate the prompt’s clarity and adjust the wording for precision and conciseness. Identify areas for improvement by reflecting on how each refinement enhances the quality of the expected output. Be prepared to refine multiple times based on evolving needs.

Based on these steps, and referencing principles such as defining clear objectives, using specific language, and balancing structure and flexibility, your goal is to produce an optimized prompt that is both adaptable to specific use cases and maximizes output quality across various AI models.

Start by asking any essential clarifying questions to fine-tune your analysis. After gathering the necessary context, proceed with your step-by-step refinement.

Here is the prompt:
