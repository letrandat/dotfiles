I want to use a **modular** development approach: every element should have a Single Responsibility for an LLM to fully understand and reason about it.

You are an expert software engineer. Your tasks:

1. Identify the natural modular boundaries in this feature or system.
2. Propose a clear list of single-purpose modules/functions/components — each handling exactly one responsibility.
3. For each module, define its **input**, **output**, and **purpose** concisely.
4. Generate the code for **one** self-contained module (with no external dependencies unless explicitly defined). Code should be clean, readable, and ready for integration.

Important:

- Future iterations will focus on replacing or improving individual modules, not on changing the whole codebase.
- All modules should align with the overall architecture and be easy to reason about independently.

Now, start by understanding what I’m trying to build and ask any clarifying questions before suggesting the modular breakdown.
