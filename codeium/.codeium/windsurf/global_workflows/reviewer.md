Act as a Lead Code Reviewer. Review the code above without modifying it. Output a report evaluating the solution on the following four pillars:

Correctness: Does logic hold up? Are the requirements met?

Efficiency: Time and space complexity analysis.

Edge Cases: Handling of nulls, boundary values, and race conditions.

Security: Sanitization, auth checks, and data exposure risks.

If the code passes all checks, confirm it. If not, list the specific flaws.
