{"id":"df-ja0.6","title":"Test pre-commit setup with all languages","description":"## Problem Statement\nNeed to verify pre-commit works correctly for all configured languages and auto-fix functions properly.\n\n## Solution Approach\nTest each language hook individually, test manual runs, test git hook integration, verify auto-fix.\n\n## Files to Change\nNone - testing existing setup\n\n## Requirements (from specs/lint-automation/spec.md)\n- Markdown files: markdownlint-cli2 checks and auto-fixes\n- Shell scripts: shellcheck performs static analysis\n- Lua files: stylua auto-formats\n- Python files: ruff checks and auto-fixes\n- JavaScript files: eslint checks and auto-fixes\n- TypeScript files: eslint + @typescript-eslint checks and auto-fixes\n- Go files: golangci-lint checks\n- Git-aware: only changed files are checked\n\n## Dependencies\n⚠️ This task requires:\n- Task df-ja0.2: Tools installed\n- Task df-ja0.3: Config file created\n- Task df-ja0.4: Git hooks installed\n\n## Expected Outcome\n- All language hooks execute successfully\n- Auto-fix works for supported languages\n- Git hook triggers on commit\n- Only staged files are linted\n\n## Verification Steps\n- [ ] Test manual run: `pre-commit run --all-files` - executes successfully\n- [ ] Test per-language: Create sample files (.md, .sh, .lua, .py, .js, .ts, .go) with intentional issues\n- [ ] Verify auto-fix: Check if trailing whitespace, formatting issues are fixed automatically\n- [ ] Test git hook: Stage file, run git commit, verify linters run before commit\n- [ ] Test selective run: `pre-commit run --files file.py` - only checks that file\n- [ ] Claude invocation: Ask Claude to run pre-commit - no permission prompt\n\n## Context\nThis validates the entire setup. Test files can be temporary and deleted after verification. Some hooks may skip if no files of that type exist.","status":"closed","priority":2,"issue_type":"task","created_at":"2026-01-01T08:50:48.0607-08:00","created_by":"dat","updated_at":"2026-01-01T09:14:13.313808-08:00","closed_at":"2026-01-01T09:14:13.313813-08:00","labels":["lint","testing","validation"]}
