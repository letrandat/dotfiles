# Proposal: OpenSpec-Beads Integration Flow

**Change ID**: `openspec-beads-flow`
**Status**: DRAFT

## Summary

Establish workflows to integrate OpenSpec design and spec processes with Beads task management.

## Motivation

The user has two powerful systems:

1. **OpenSpec** (Design Documents): Detailed planning.
2. **Beads** (Task Management): Task tracking.

Currently, these systems are disconnected. We need a unified workflow that acts as a funnel from "Vague Idea" to "Concrete Execution":

1.  **Brainstorming (Explore)**: Use natural language dialogue to generate a Design Doc.
2.  **OpenSpec (Define)**: Formalize the Design Doc into a "Contract" (Spec).
3.  **Beads (Execute)**: Break the Validated Spec into trackable Work Units.

This proposal builds that bridge.
