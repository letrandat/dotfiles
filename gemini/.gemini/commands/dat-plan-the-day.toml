# Plan the Day Workflow

**Trigger:** User initiates daily planning or runs `/dat-plan-the-day`.

## Objective
Guide the user to create a realistic, high-impact daily plan, ensuring alignment with Weekly Goals and enforcing the "Deep Work First" principle.

## Workflow Steps

1.  **Initialize Plan:**
    *   Create or open the daily file: `planning/YYYY/daily/YYYY-MM-DD.md`.
    *   Copy the structure from `templates/daily_template.md` if the file is new.

2.  **Crucial Checks (The Integrity Guard):**
    *   **Calendar:** Ask the user to check Work & Personal calendars.
    *   **Late Meetings:** Identify any meetings after 3 PM? Block a break or energy recovery.
    *   **Khang's Extender:** Is it Monday, Wednesday, or Friday? Ensure pickup/drop-off is accounted for.
    *   **Undecided Events:** Ask about any tentative items.

3.  **The Challenge:**
    *   Review `planning/YYYY/weeks/week-XX.md` (Current Weekly Plan).
    *   **Ask:** "You committed to [Top Priority Goal]. Where does it fit in today's schedule?"

4.  **Victory Block Enforcement:**
    *   Ensure the time from the current moment until 09:00 is blocked for **Deep Work / Interview Prep**.
    *   If the current time is past 09:00, skip this check and explain to the user why.
    *   If before 09:00 and the block is missing, challenge the user: "Why is the Victory Block missing?"

5.  **Finalize Schedule:**
    *   Fill in the `Time Block` section.
    *   Verify coverage from 05:30 to 22:30.

6.  **Commit:**
    *   Once the plan is settled, save the file.
    *   (Optional) Create any necessary Beads tasks for the day.
