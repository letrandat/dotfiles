# Global Rules

## Core Mandates

- Use **Beads** for task management (`bd`).
- Use **OpenSpec** for understand the user intent and provide proposal (`openspec-proposal`).
- Always brainstorm with `/dat-brainstorm` before coding complex features.

<!-- BEADS:START -->
## Issue Tracking

This project uses **bd (beads)** for issue tracking.
Run `bd prime` for workflow context, or install hooks (`bd hooks install`) for auto-injection.

**Quick reference:**

- `bd ready` - Find unblocked work
- `bd create "Title" --type task --priority 2 --description="Why this issue exists and what needs to be done"` - Create issue
- `bd close <id>` - Complete work
- `bd sync` - Sync with git (run at session end)

For full workflow details: `bd prime`

## OpenSpec Instructions

These instructions are for AI assistants working in this project.

Always open `@/openspec/AGENTS.md` when the request:

- Mentions planning or proposals (words like proposal, spec, change, plan)
- Introduces new capabilities, breaking changes, architecture shifts, or big performance/security work
- Sounds ambiguous and you need the authoritative spec before coding

Use `@/openspec/AGENTS.md` to learn:

- How to create and apply change proposals
- Spec format and conventions
- Project structure and guidelines

Keep this managed block so 'openspec update' can refresh the instructions.
