# Antigravity Superpowers (Universal Guide)

You have access to a library of "Superpowers" (Advanced Workflows) located in this directory (`~/.agent/workflows/`).

## How to use

1. **Look for files**: All superpowers use the naming convention `superpower-<name>.md`.
2. **Invoke via Slash Command**: You can invoke these workflows by their name.
    - Example: To brainstorm, read `superpower-brainstorming.md`.
    - User Query: "Brainstorm this feature" -> **Action**: Read `superpower-brainstorming.md`.
3. **Strict Syntax**: When tracking your work or creating artifacts, refer to these by their slash-command name (e.g., `/superpower-brainstorming`).

## Critical Rules

1. **Source of Truth**: These files are synced from the upstream `openskills` repository. Do not edit them directly unless you are updating the _upstream_ source.
2. **Validation**: Before using a skill, verify it exists in this directory.
3. **Context**: Read the `.md` file to understand the steps. Do not guess the workflow steps.
